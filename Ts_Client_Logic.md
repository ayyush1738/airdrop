### Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use TypeScript for Client-side development?

I believe Solana chose TypeScript for a few practical reasons:

1. **Error Prevention**  
   TypeScript helps reduce bugs by catching mistakes early, which is important when dealing with complex blockchain transactions.

2. **Type Safety**  
   With TypeScript, developers can define exact data types, making it easier to work with structured data and avoid unexpected errors.

3. **Browser Compatibility**  
   TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, so it works in any browser without extra setup or compatibility issues.

4. **Better Developer Experience**  
   Features like autocomplete, type hints, and intelligent suggestions make coding faster and less error-prone for developers.
